# AIKO Project - Virtual Assistant

## AIKO-core
  
   The CORE repository contains the necessary information for the assistant to understand the user's intentions.
   Thus, all platforms that implement a visualization for AIKO must access this service to obtain the answers and actions to be delivered according to each input provided by the user (acknowledgment of intentions).
